# My DSA Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms** journey! I'm learning, practicing, and documenting everything here as I work to become a more proficient problem-solver. Let's explore some core concepts and tackle coding challenges together!

---

## 📝 Why DSA?
- Enhance my **problem-solving skills**.
- Prepare for **technical interviews**.
- Build a strong **foundation in algorithms**.

---

## 📈 Goals
- Solve **100 problems** on LeetCode.
- Master **sorting algorithms**.
- Learn **dynamic programming**.

---

# 🗂️ Structure
Here's how I'm organizing this repository:

## 1. Data Structures
Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks & Queues
Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
Heaps
Graphs
Hash Tables

## 2. Algorithms
Searching (Binary Search, etc.)
Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)
Recursion
Dynamic Programming
Greedy Algorithms
Backtracking
Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Language**: C++
- **Platform**: LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank , CodeShef

---

> **Note**: Stay consistent and keep practicing every day. 💪
